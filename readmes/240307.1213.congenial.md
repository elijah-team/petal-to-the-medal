Elijah congenial-robot
=======================

The elijah-lang compiler/package manager.

Elijah is:

- ... a high-level language built to explore \[insert goal here\].
- ... a historical curiosity.
- ... meant to be easy to use standalone or with existing projects.
- ... free software (LGPL) intended for use on all systems, aka Linux.
- ... philosophically opposed to semicolons

[`congenial-robot`][1] is:

- ... implemented in Java (17, for now; 8 is great and Graal is your paal)
- ... of the impression that build systems don't matter [2][2] [4][4] [5][5] (tldr maven for now)
- ... mortal enemies of Scala
- ... a friend of Eclipse and therefore not Lombok (but only when it's not trying that hard)
- ... a friend of Xtend
- ... is not really all that concerned by Kotlin (see [Verification][3])
